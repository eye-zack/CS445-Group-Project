We have included two versions of the dynamic model which both demonstrate the necessary information. 
The reason we have chosen to include both is one (dynamic_model_clothing) uses traditional UML stereotypes and illustrates a step-by-step process of the application at work.
The diagram titled Dynamic_Model_Weather, on the other hand, gives an extensive illustration of the way the application interacts with itself and the user at all times.
