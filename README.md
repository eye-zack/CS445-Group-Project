## IF IT WILL NOT RUN
it is more than likely missing some packages: 
1. in the terminal, move to the Wearther App directory and run 'npm ci' to do a clean install
2. run 'npm i react-scripts@latest' to get the newest reacts scripts available
3. in the Wearther App folder, locate the package.json file, go the "devDependencies" in the folder, and add "react-scripts": "5.0.1"   
4. run 'npm i web-vitals --save-dev' 
5. run 'npm start' and it will run
