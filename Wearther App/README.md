•	Links to CSS and JavaScript files.
3.	public/styles/:
•	Folder for CSS files.
•	main.css: Main CSS file for global styles.
•	components/: Folder for CSS files specific to individual components.
4.	public/scripts/:
•	Folder for JavaScript files.
•	main.js: Main JavaScript file for global scripts.

5.	public/images/:
•	Folder for images used in the application.
6.	public/fonts/:
•	Folder for font files (if using custom fonts).
7.	src/:
•	Contains the source code for the application.
8.	src/components/:
•	Reusable UI components that can be used across multiple pages.
•	Each component has its HTML, CSS, React.js, and JS files.
9.	src/pages/:
•	Different pages of the application.
•	Each page has its HTML, CSS, React.js and JS files.
10.	src/utils/:
•	Utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
11.	src/data/:
•	Contains mock data or logic for fetching data from APIs.
12.	src/app.js:
•	Main entry point for the application.
•	Initializes the app, sets up event listeners, and renders components/pages.
13.	.gitignore:
•	Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, dist/, etc.).
14.	README.md:
•	Project documentation with setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.
15.	package.json:
•	Contains metadata about the project and lists all dependencies.
•	Scripts for running the app, testing, building, etc., are defined here.
Notes:
•	Modular Approach:
•	The application is structured using a modular approach, separating components, pages, styles, and scripts into different directories.
•	Each component/page has its own folder containing HTML, CSS, and JS files.
•	Reusable Components:
•	Components in the src/components/ folder are reusable UI elements (like buttons, cards, modals, etc.) that can be used across different pages.
•	They encapsulate their own HTML, CSS, and JS, making them self-contained and easy to manage.
•	Page Structure:
•	Pages in the src/pages/ folder represent different views or sections of the application.
•	Each page has its own folder containing HTML, CSS, and JS files specific to that page.
•	Utility Functions:
•	The src/utils/ folder holds utility functions that can be used across the application for common tasks like data formatting, validation, etc.
•	Data Handling:
•	The src/data/ folder might contain mock data files for testing purposes or logic to fetch data from APIs.
