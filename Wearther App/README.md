For Windows Users:

    Run the setup script:
    Right-click on setup.ps1 and select "Run with PowerShell", or run it from the PowerShell interface as an administrator:

.\setup.ps1

This script will install Git if it's not already present, set up Node.js, install all the necessary Node packages for both the client and the server, and carry out any additional required setup tasks.

For Linux Users:

    Run the setup script:
    Make the script executable and run it:

./setup.sh

If you encounter permissions issues, you may need to modify the script's permissions first:

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

This script will install Node.js, set up the necessary Node packages for both the client and the server, and perform any other required setup tasks.

Explanations:

2.	public/index.html:
•	Main HTML file serving as the entry point of the application.
•	Links to CSS and JavaScript files.
3.	public/styles/:
•	Folder for CSS files.
•	main.css: Main CSS file for global styles.
•	components/: Folder for CSS files specific to individual components.
4.	public/scripts/:
•	Folder for JavaScript files.
•	main.js: Main JavaScript file for global scripts.
•	modules/: Folder for JavaScript files specific to modules or components.
5.	public/images/:
•	Folder for images used in the application.
6.	public/fonts/:
•	Folder for font files (if using custom fonts).
7.	src/:
•	Contains the source code for the application.
8.	src/components/:
•	Reusable UI components that can be used across multiple pages.
•	Each component has its HTML, CSS, React.js, and JS files.
9.	src/pages/:
•	Different pages of the application.
•	Each page has its HTML, CSS, React.js and JS files.
10.	src/utils/:
•	Utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
11.	src/data/:
•	Contains mock data or logic for fetching data from APIs.
12.	src/app.js:
•	Main entry point for the application.
•	Initializes the app, sets up event listeners, and renders components/pages.
13.	.gitignore:
•	Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, dist/, etc.).
14.	README.md:
•	Project documentation with setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.
15.	package.json:
•	Contains metadata about the project and lists all dependencies.
•	Scripts for running the app, testing, building, etc., are defined here.
Notes:
•	Modular Approach:
•	The application is structured using a modular approach, separating components, pages, styles, and scripts into different directories.
•	Each component/page has its own folder containing HTML, CSS, and JS files.
•	Reusable Components:
•	Components in the src/components/ folder are reusable UI elements (like buttons, cards, modals, etc.) that can be used across different pages.
•	They encapsulate their own HTML, CSS, and JS, making them self-contained and easy to manage.
•	Page Structure:
•	Pages in the src/pages/ folder represent different views or sections of the application.
•	Each page has its own folder containing HTML, CSS, and JS files specific to that page.
•	Utility Functions:
•	The src/utils/ folder holds utility functions that can be used across the application for common tasks like data formatting, validation, etc.
•	Data Handling:
•	The src/data/ folder might contain mock data files for testing purposes or logic to fetch data from APIs.
